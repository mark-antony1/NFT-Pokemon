# NFT Pokemon

This is the solidity contract code for a project deployed on rinkeby testnet

The project allows users to mint NFTs(pokemon) and use them to attack a boss(Mewtwo).

Users can mint multiple pokemon for their team.

Critical hits are implemented with Chainlink Oracles

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
